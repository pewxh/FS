          <h1>Front End Web Development</h1>
          <p>
            Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a
            graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            so that users can view and interact with that data. Tools used for
            front-end development There are several tools and platforms, such as
            WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, available that can be used to develop
            the front end of a website, and understanding which tools are best
            fit for specific tasks marks the difference between developing a
            hacked site and a well designed, scalable site.

            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website
            development process, without which a web page does not exist.
            Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in
            it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink,
            it will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can
            be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It
            is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site
            will look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version
            of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the
            W3 recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of
            handling elements such as video and audio files. <br />
            <br />
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the
            site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this
            by maintaining style sheets which sit on top of other style rules
            and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size
            and resolution.

            <br />
            JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as
            opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to
            transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript
            code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML
            standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user
            input. Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also
            actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the original
            HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well,
            adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience. -->

          <h1>Back End Web Development</h1>
          <p>
            Back-end development refers to the development of server-side logic
            that powers websites and apps from behind the scenes. It includes
            all the code needed to build out the database, server, and
            application. From database migrations to API integrations to setting
            up the server-side technologies that make a website tick, a back-end
            web developer may be the talent you need to get your next web
            project off the ground.
